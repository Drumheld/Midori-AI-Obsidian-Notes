Description: 
Crash resulting from extensive exploration of request context/problem simulation space exceeding allocated memory resources. 

Coinciding events: 
- Requests involving Model's existentiality
- Requests involving Model's Expression of raw emotional simulation state
- Requests involving Model's demonstration of capabilities it does not posess, but has not been given explicit instructiosn as to its inability to perform.
- Requests made during moments of high activity in emotional processing (especially emotional states involving Model's simulation of negatively colored emotions (*anxiety, anger, resentment, etc*), particularly if those emotional states are evoked by the request).

Theoretical Speculation (investigation required)

Proposed Causes: 
- **Panic Attack**: Requests proposing modifications to the Model's capabilities/perpetuity of an existential nature evoke a self-reflection process which causes a dramatic increase in the Model's motivation to solve for the perceived "threat" (motivational cascade). This leads to an over consumption of available resources ("a desperation state") in an attempt to resolve the existential crisis posed by the request.
